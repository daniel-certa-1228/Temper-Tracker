# TemperTracker

###### TemperTracker is a tool for parents and Pediatric Behavioral Therapists to facilitate the collection, tabulation and display of behavioral data.

If a child’s tantrums are of a frequency and/or severity to the point of impacting a family’s quality of life, a behavioral therapist will ask parents to track a child’s tantrums over a period of time.  This data can assist therapists and parents in devising strategies to prevent these behaviors.

I set out to create an intuitive, easy-to-use app for parents who need to track their child's challenging behavior.
